# Bot-Escape-Game
A Python game using skills learned from the MOOC.Fi Course

In Unit 14 of the Python 2022 course, a final project is required using PyGame. It is limited in its scope, with png images for a robot, door, and a ball. My game will combine the elements of Unit 13 to create an Escape Game.
